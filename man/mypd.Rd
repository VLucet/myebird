\title{Total phylogenetic distance of species in your eBird lists.}
\usage{
mypd(mydata)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydata}{Data frame created with \code{\link{ebirdclean}}.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the mean ("mean_pd"), median ("median_pd"), and standard
 deviation ("sd_pd") vaules; units are in million years.
}
\description{
\code{mypd} provides the evolutionary time encompassed by your eBird checklist
based on Jetz et al. (2014).
}
\details{
Phylogenetic distance (PD) is simply the sum of all branch lengths of a tree,
and represents the total evolutionary time covered by the species in the tree.
Values returned by \code{mypd} are in million years of evolution, and are based
in a subset of 20 trees from Jetz et al. (2014) using the full taxonomy and
Hackett "structure". See \code{raw-data/load-bird-trees.R} for more info on
how the trees were extracted from the original source.#'

\examples{
\dontrun{
mylist <- ebirdclean("MyEBirdData.csv")

# To look at PD values by country (using dplyr):
mybirds \%>\%
  group_by(Country) \%>\%
  do(mypd(.))}
